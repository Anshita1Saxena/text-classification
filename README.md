# text-classification
This repository shows Text Classification where data was generated by ChatGPT prompt and then performed the experiments.
 "facts.txt" and "fakes.txt" are the datasets contains the dataset generated from ChatGPT, and a1.py is the code-script.

To run this code-script, the command is given below:-

python -W ignore .\a1.py

Sample Input:-

Please enter the fact file path:- facts.txt
Please enter the fake file path:- fakes.txt

This code script will ask you to enter the facts.txt and fakes.txt file paths and run automatically to generate three files "accuracies_pre_processing.txt" (has all the preprocessing techniques results-863 experiments), "best_grid_parameters_accuracies.txt (has best grid parameter results)" and "final_results.txt (has final results)". "real_vs_fake_preliminary_for_learning.ipynb" file has preliminary learning code and results which is used to learn, perform, and write the a1.py script to complete this assignment.
